### The Project - Space Invaders

Space Invaders - the technical phenominon created in 1978 by Japanese Game Company TAITO CORP.
I decided to base this project on the original game as I lvoe the aethetic of pixelated art. Alongside the music and the *somewhat* simplicity of the game mecanics, I thought this would be a worthy challenge for my coding abilities (little did I know that I would find it rather difficult).
The project itself took me around 5 days to complete
