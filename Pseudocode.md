I want to update a scoreboard whenever an enemy is hit
    I need to create scoreboard
        I do this by creating a variable 'let' that starts at 0
    I need to log whenever an enemy is hit with a missle
        I need to find the code that registers a hit an += 100 to the score
    I need to show that score on the screen
        I create an innerText funciton that allows me to create the 'score: 0'
    I need to update that scoreboard
        I need to make sure that everytime the score goes up, so does the scoreboard
